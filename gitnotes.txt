Conflict resolution

If there is a conflict, Github will modify the txt file with conflict markers.

To resolve the conflict on Bash text editor:
>> remove those conflict markers, make the required text changes (local Gitbash)
>> Add (local GitBash)
>> Commit (local GitBash)
>> Push (local GitBash)

Branching: "git branch --list"

To change branch:
>> git checkout master
or
>> git checkout dev_venus

When pushing form a new brack for the first time, need to follow set-upstream instructions

To merge, use "git merge dev_venus"
